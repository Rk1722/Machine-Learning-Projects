Overview:

A bunch of different projects which started off my exploration into machine learning and algorithmic trading. Some good projects here are Netflix Film Recommendation,1 Recommendaiton1, Cimbtr:

Here is what each one does roughly:

- Netflix Film Recommendation: Using collaborative and content based rating system, to find which film is best for you based on what other have seen and wlooking at similar films that are highly regarded.
- Recommendation1:Used K-means clustering to find similar products for amazon recommendation
- Cimbtr: Kaggle project came in top 15% for. It looked at getting survival rates for surgery patients. Created a combined XGBoost and Catboost model for this.
